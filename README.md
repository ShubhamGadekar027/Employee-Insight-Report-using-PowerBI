# Employee-Insight-Report-using-PowerBI
In this PowerBI project, the data related to employees of a company is analyzed. The data columns include information about the hire date, number of remaining employees, pay type, reason for separation, age group, tenure in days and months, leave balance, number of sick days in the last 12 months, current salary, and current employee rating. The project aims to uncover insights and patterns related to employee demographics and job performance. Visualizations and reports are created to represent this information in a clear and actionable format. The project helps to identify trends and make informed decisions about workforce management, employee compensation, and overall company performance.
